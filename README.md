# Unescapable Room

This project was created in code academy in java using the simpleGfx library with a group of four people.
<p> The purpose  was to create a game. </p>
<p> The game consisted of the puppet moving left and right with the keyboard, in which he had to escape from the handcuffs and pick up the paintings.</p> 
<br>
<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project. </p>
<p>There were some challenging days, but even on those, we could laugh with the bugs and fix them. </p>
<p>It was an incredible and rewarding experience. </p>
